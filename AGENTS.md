- Data lives in Lovable Cloud; `src/lib/store.ts` and `src/lib/accounts.ts` keep a sync in-memory store hydrated from DB + realtime so UI stays synchronous. Why: minimal UI churn.
- Phone login uses synthetic email `<phone>@alinamart.app` with auto-confirm. Why: phone+password without SMS.
- Admin role auto-assigned to phone 9301499921 by `handle_new_user` trigger; roles in `user_roles`. Why: no client-side role escalation.
- The payment notice uses a fixed UTC deadline (2026-10-04T10:52:33Z) in the root layout; it is presentation-only, not payment verification or backend shutdown. Why: all visitors see the same seven-day window without resetting on refresh.
